\usage{
sn_install_micromamba(
  install_dir = "~/.local/bin",
  force = FALSE,
  version = "latest"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{install_dir}{Character. The directory where `micromamba` should be installed.
Default is `~/.local/bin`.}

\item{force}{Logical. If `TRUE`, forces reinstallation even if `micromamba` is already installed. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{version}{Character. The version of micromamba to install.
Use `"latest"` (default) for the latest stable version.}
}
\value{
A character string: the full path to the installed `micromamba` binary.
}
\description{
This function installs [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html),
a lightweight `conda`-compatible package manager, into a user-defined directory. It automatically detects the
operating system and architecture, downloads the appropriate binary, and extracts it into the specified location.
}
\details{
If `micromamba` is already installed at the target location, and `force = FALSE`, the existing binary is reused.

The function sets the `SN_MICROMAMBA` environment variable to the installed binary path, so that other ShennongTools
functions can access it automatically.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Install micromamba to the default location
sn_install_micromamba()

# Force reinstall micromamba
sn_install_micromamba(force = TRUE)

# Install a specific version
sn_install_micromamba(version = "1.5.6")
}
