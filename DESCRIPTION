Description: 
    ShennongTools provides a unified, extensible interface for managing and executing
    bioinformatics tools using YAML-based configurations. It enables reproducible,
    command-line driven analysis through an R API (`sn_run()`) that supports argument
    templating, resource monitoring, conda-based environment management, and structured
    output handling. Tools are modeled as S4 objects and organized into toolboxes,
    making the system scalable, composable, and suitable for high-throughput workflows.
